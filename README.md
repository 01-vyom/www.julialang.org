This is the GitHub repository for the Julia Programming Language's main website, [julialang.org](http://julialang.org/). The repository for the source code of the language itself can be found at [github.com/JuliaLang/julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).

The Julia website is generated using GitHub pages and Hugo, as [explained here](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).

# Installing locally

You can either download a single binary file for Hugo from
[Hugo releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) or you can install
it as per the instructions [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

To build and serve the website run:

    hugo server

in the root of this repository. You can then visit [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313)
to view the site.
