In a world where we have numerous languages for technical computing,
why do we need a fresh approach? There are a number of commercial ones
such as MATLAB, Mathematica, Maple, SAS, Stata, etc. There are a
number of open source languages such as R, Python+SciPy, Octave,
Scilab, etc. Just like most such projects, we started with julia to
scratch an itch.

The choices available require the programmer to choose between various
trade-offs. The best performance is typically only available if you
write your programs in C or Fortran, or if you effectively spend all
your time in code written in C or Fortran. Python is incredibly
versatile, has a rich general purpose library, and with SciPy,
provides a good array library. However, computation that is done
natively in python for numerical computing is several orders of
magnitude slower than C or Fortran. The same problem affects R for
statistical applications â€” libraries are fast as they call C code, but
native R is slow. Matlab does have a JIT, but is still no replacement
for C, and it costs a lot of money. We feel that in today's world, it
is reasonable for a programmer to demand all the good stuff in one
language.

Some of the features of Julia are:

1. <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/LICENSE.md">Open source</a>. The core of julia is licensed under the MIT license.
2. <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Getting-Started">A very high level language</a>: Syntax is similar to that of other
technical computing languages.
3. <a href="http://www.julialang.org/">High performance</a>: Julia's
LLVM-based JIT compiler combined with the language's design allow it
to approach and often match the performance of C/C++. Much of Julia's
standard library, and some compiler passes are implemented in Julia
itself.
4. <a
href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Arrays">Programming with
arrays</a>: vectorized code can be written just like in other
languages. However, it is not mandatory to write vectorized code for
performance.
5. <a
href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Calling-C-and-Fortran-Code">Calling
C/Fortran code</a>: Julia provides a simple and straightforward way to
call C/Fortran code, with minimal boilerplate.
6. Dynamic: The language design centers around <a
href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Types">type
inference</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Methods">multiple
dispatch</a>.
7. Multiple UIs: The compiler functionality is provided as a library,
so that multiple front ends can be written for different
purposes. This is demonstrated through the implementation of a <a
href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Getting-Started#wiki-Installation-and-Running">command-line
REPL</a>, and a <a href="http://julialang.org/images/web_repl.png">web
REPL</a>.

We invite the reader to try it out Julia and <a

think.
