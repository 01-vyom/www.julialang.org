In a world where we have numerous languages for technical computing,
why do we need a fresh approach? There are a number of commercial ones
such as MATLAB, Mathematica, Maple, SAS, Stata, etc. There are a
number of open source languages such as R, Python+SciPy, Octave,
Scilab, etc. Just like most such projects, we started Julia to
scratch an itch.

The systems available require programmers to choose among various
trade-offs. The best performance is typically only available if you
write in C or Fortran, or if you effectively spend all
your time in code written in C or Fortran. Python is incredibly
versatile, has a rich general purpose library, and with NumPy/SciPy,
provides a good array library. However, computation done
natively in python is orders of
magnitude slower than C or Fortran. The same problem affects R for
statistical applications â€” libraries are fast as they call C code, but
native R is slow. Matlab does have a JIT, but is still no replacement
for C, and it costs a lot of money. We feel that in today's world, it
is reasonable for a programmer to demand all the good stuff in one
language.

A surprisingly large number of "technical computing languages" have been
built with the same basic design of calling C libraries from an interpreter.
This approach is OK for the minority of programs that only do large array
operations, but performance starts to degrade significantly as the arrays
get smaller. It is common to need, for instance, a large number of 3x3
arrays, and in that case dispatch overhead can dominate computation.
Flexibility is also an issue: what if you want matrix multiplication with
different operators, for example max-plus algebra? What about different
arithmetics, such as intervals or fixed-point? What we need is a language
that retains ease-of-use, but can also better understand what your program
is doing in order to systematically eliminate overhead. We don't
give anything up in using such a language, since *any* language can
call the same C and Fortran libraries that existing sytems use.

Statically-typed functional languages have popularized type inference as
a way to increase productivity without giving up performance or static
checking. Julia takes this trend in a different direction: we provide the
productivity and performance benefits of type inference without enforcing
any static restrictions (Julia's type system and inference algorithm are
also different from those used by statically type-inferred languages).
This means everything still happens at run time, as in familiar dynamic
languages like Python, Perl and Ruby. Julia achieves this goal using
*dynamic type inference*, a feature not often seen among the languages
that have been widely available so far.

Some other notable features of Julia are:

1. <a
href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/LICENSE.md">Open
source</a>. The core of julia is licensed under the MIT license.
2. <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Getting-Started">A
very high level language</a>: Syntax is similar to that of other
technical computing languages.
3. <a href="http://www.julialang.org/">High performance</a>: Julia's
LLVM-based JIT compiler combined with the language's design allow it
to approach and often match the performance of C/C++. Julia's
standard library, and some compiler passes, are implemented in Julia
itself.
4. <a
href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Parallel-Computing">Parallel</a>:
Julia already provides facilities for data parallel
and task parallel computations.
5. <a
href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Arrays">Programming with
arrays</a>: vectorized code can be written just like in other
languages. However, it is not mandatory to write vectorized code for
performance.
6. <a
href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Calling-C-and-Fortran-Code">Calling
C/Fortran code</a>: Julia provides a straightforward way to
call C/Fortran code, with minimal boilerplate.
7. Dynamic: The language design centers around <a
href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Methods">multiple
dispatch</a>, a powerful way to define functions that is usually more fun
than using classes and inheritance.
8. Multiple UIs: The compiler functionality is provided as a library,
so that multiple front ends can be written for different
purposes. This is demonstrated through the implementation of a <a
href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Getting-Started#wiki-Installation-and-Running">command-line REPL</a>, and a
<a href="http://julialang.org/images/web_repl.png">web REPL</a>.

We invite the reader to try out Julia and <a

think.
