In which Jeff describes the schism between the fast implementation language and the slow user-facing language.
E.g. C and Python; C and Matlab; C and Ruby; C and R (not to be confused with K & R).
Actually, it's pretty much always C.
Sometimes C++. But calling mangled C++ names from other languages is crazy, so it's usually C.
He also delves into why this is detrimental to the progress of high-quality libraries for these systems and how Julia does it differently.
