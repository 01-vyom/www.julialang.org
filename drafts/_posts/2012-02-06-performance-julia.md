In which Stefan presents a companion article to [Performance Python](http://www.scipy.org/PerformancePython).
He first presents the obvious, plain-Julia implementation of the `numericTimeStep` function.
That's it.
There is no more.
It just works and it's *as* fast as C, not nearly as fast.
There is no code embedded in strings.
Performance Julia is just Julia.
