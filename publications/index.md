* [Julia: A Fast Dynamic Language for Technical Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5145)

Dynamic languages have become popular for scientific computing. They
are generally considered highly productive, but lacking in
performance. This paper presents Julia, a new dynamic language for
technical computing, designed for performance from the beginning by
adapting and extending modern programming language techniques. A
design based on generic functions and a rich type system
simultaneously enables an expressive programming model and successful
type inference, leading to good performance for a wide range of
programs. This makes it possible for much of the Julia library to be
written in Julia itself, while also incorporating best-of-breed C and
Fortran libraries.

* [Computing in Operations Research using Julia](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1431)

The state of numerical computing is currently characterized by a
divide between highly efficient yet typically cumbersome low-level
languages such as C, C++, and Fortran and highly expressive yet
typically slow high-level languages such as Python and MATLAB. This
paper explores how Julia, a modern programming language for numerical
computing which claims to bridge this divide by incorporating recent
advances in language and compiler design (such as just-in-time
compilation), can be used for implementing software and algorithms
fundamental to the field of operations research, with a focus on
mathematical optimization. In particular, we demonstrate algebraic
modeling for linear and nonlinear optimization and a partial
implementation of a practical simplex code. Extensive cross-language
benchmarks suggest that Julia is capable of obtaining state-of-the-art
performance.
