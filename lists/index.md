The [julia-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-users) mailing list is for discussion around the usage of julia. New users of julia can ask their questions here. As a courtesy to others, do check the archives and documentation to see if a particular question is already answered.

The [julia-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-dev) mailing list is for discussion related to the development of julia itself.

The [julia-stats](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-stats) mailing list is a special purpose mailing list for discussions related to statistical programming with julia. Topics of interest include DataFrame support, GLM modeling, and automatic generation of MCMC code for Bayesian models.
