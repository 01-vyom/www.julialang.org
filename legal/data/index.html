The information allows the developers of Julia improve Julia and its ecosystem. We try to collect minimal information necessary to accurately estimate important characteristics of Julia&#39;s usage patterns. The <a href="#Data-Overview">Data Overview</a> section breaks down what data is sent, what each item means, why it&#39;s sent, and how collecting this information helps us understand Julia&#39;s usage and improve its ecosystem. The <a href="#Opting-Out">Opting Out</a> section, gives details about how to opt out of sending telemetry partially or entirely.</p> <h2 id=data_overview ><a href="#data_overview">Data Overview</a></h2> <p>Telemetry data is sent in the form of HTTP headers included in each request to the server, each of which starts with <code>Julia-</code>. The exact information that is sent to your current package server can be determined by calling <code>Pkg.telemetryinfo&#40;&#41;</code> :</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs">julia&gt; <span class=hljs-keyword >import</span> Pkg

Julia-HyperLogLog: <span class=hljs-number >405</span>,<span class=hljs-number >2</span>
Julia-Interactive: <span class=hljs-literal >true</span></code></pre> In what follows, we will go through each header, giving an example, an explanation of what it means, why it&#39;s sent, and how collecting this data helps us understand Julia&#39;s usage and improve it and its ecosystem.</p> <h3 id=pkg_protocol ><a href="#pkg_protocol">Pkg Protocol</a></h3> <pre><code class="text hljs">Julia-Pkg-Protocol: 1.0</code></pre> This is the version number of the Pkg protocol that the client supports, which allows the server to know which features the client has. It is the only telemetry header which is not optional since it is necessary for correct interaction between the client and server. Currently <code>1.0</code> is the only possible value, so this header gives zero information &#40;for now&#41;.</p>
<h3 id=version ><a href="#version">Version</a></h3>
<pre><code class="text hljs">Julia-Version: 1.5.0</code></pre> This is the value of the <code>VERSION</code> global variable. It helps us understand which versions of Julia people are using, which in turn helps package developers make informed decisions about how much effort they should put into maintaining support for various versions of Julia. Without this information, we have no way of knowing what the usage distribution over different versions of the language is. It is also necessary for interpreting some of the other values, such as <code>Julia-System</code> since the format and meaning of the returned value can change with different versions of Julia.</p>
<h3 id=system ><a href="#system">System</a></h3>
<pre><code class="text hljs">Julia-System: x86_64-apple-darwin14-libgfortran5</code></pre> This is the so-called &quot;platform triplet&quot; which identifies the details of what architecture, operating system, kernel version, and other ABI &#40;&quot;application binary interface&quot;&#41; features your system needs. Knowing the number of users of each operating system helps Julia&#39;s developers and package developers prioritize support for different operating system.  Julia&#39;s package manager provides pre-compiled binary libraries for many dependencies; these are selected using precisely this triplet value, so knowing how many users there are for each possible triplet value helps understand where limited support efforts should be spent to benefit the greatest number of users. You can opt out of this header by turning telemetry off entirely.</p>
<h3 id=client_uuid ><a href="#client_uuid">Client UUID</a></h3>
<pre><code class="text hljs">Julia-Client-UUID: afda810c-134c-4059-9594-3d1b0e9f0928</code></pre> Unless you have opted of client UUIDs, the first time the Julia client connects to a package server, it generates a random client UUID, which it sends with each request. This helps us estimate the number of Julia installs there are, which in combination with some of the other telemetry data allows estimating the number of Julia users. Having client UUIDs is essential for answering this question, since otherwise there&#39;s no way to distinguish a single install making a thousand requests from a thousand clients making a single request each. It also helps us answer other significant questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How often do users upgrade Julia?</p>

<li><p>How often do users upgrade packages?</p>

<li><p>How many users of each Julia package are there?</p>

<li><p>For a given pair of packages, how many clients use both?</p>

<li><p>How many package operations does a typical user perform in a given unit of time?</p>

</ul>
<p>Being able to answer these kinds of questions helps to improve the Julia experience for everyone. For example, if most users upgrade Julia as soon as possible, we should consider making more frequent Julia releases, whereas if most users only upgrade every six months or longer, then we might want to consider making less frequent releases and spend our limited time and energy budget on other aspects of development.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that <em>&quot;how many Julia users are there?&quot;</em> is the first question asked by organizations of all kinds—commercial, philanthropic and governmental—when they are considering investing in Julia, whether by giving grants to support open source work, by sponsoring JuliaCon, or by adopting the language for development of their own software systems.</p>
<h3 id=project_hash ><a href="#project_hash">Project Hash</a></h3>
<pre><code class="text hljs">Julia-Project-Hash: fb03cd4baee60f383ef185fb5884d852766df25c</code></pre> This hash value uniquely identifies the path of the active project without revealing any information about that path. Having this value allows determining when packages are dependencies of the same project, as opposed to being used in different projects on one client: if two requests have the same project hash value, they are used by the same project; if they have different project hashes, they are not. No other information is revealed by this cryptographic hash value: you can only compare them to see if they are the same or different. Comparisons of hash values across different systems are meaningless and provide no information.</p>
<p>Privacy of the user is protected by using a random secret salt value and applying a strong cryptographic hash &#40;SHA2-224&#41; to the client UUID, the secret salt value, and the active project path. The secret random salt value is generated once for each package server and never sent anywhere. The salt value is a 36-character, base-62, random string, providing 214 strongly random bits &#40;generated by <code>/dev/random</code> or equivalent&#41;. The secure hash function used to combine this salt with the client UUID and project path is SHA2-224 truncated to 180 bits &#40;the same length as SHA1; shorter hashes in this context are more secure since they&#39;re harder to invert&#41;. This hash value is sent as a 40-byte hexadecimal string.</p>
<h3 id=ci_variables ><a href="#ci_variables">CI Variables</a></h3>
<pre><code class="text hljs">Julia-CI-Variables: APPVEYOR=n;CI=n;CIRCLECI=n;CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION=n;GITHUB_ACTIONS=n
GITLAB_CI=n;JULIA_CI=n;TF_BUILD=n;TRAVIS=n</code></pre> This header gives an indicator for each of a set of environment variables that are commonly set on automated continuous integration &#40;CI&#41; systems, such as AppVeyor, Azure Pipelines, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, GitLab, and Travis CI. On user systems, theses will typically not be set. When analyzing requests to package servers, these indictors help to distinguish request from automated CI systems from real users. Automated CI systems can initiate a lot of requests and tend to be ephemeral, so they may have a different client UUID each time they run, which means that they can significantly pollute the statistics gleaned from package server request records. Due to the large volume of requests that can be initiated by CI systems, it is also often necessary to handle these systems specially to reduce service costs, e.g. by configuring CI processes to use a package server that is co-located with the CI service. Without the ability to identify such CI requests, it would be hard or impossible to identify and mitigate these costly automated requests to package servers.</p>
<p>For each environment variable that is checked, there are only four possible values:</p>
<div class=tight-list ><ul>
<li><p><strong>No value:</strong> if an environment variable is not set, that is encoded as <code>n</code></p>

<li><p><strong>True</strong>: if it is set and has one of the values <code>true</code>, <code>t</code>,  <code>yes</code>, <code>y</code>, or <code>1</code>, that is encoded as <code>t</code></p>

<li><p><strong>False</strong>: if it is set and has one of the values <code>false</code>, <code>f</code>,  <code>no</code>, <code>n</code>, or <code>0</code>, that is encoded as <code>f</code></p>

<li><p><strong>Other</strong>: if it is set and has any other value, that is encoded as <code>o</code>.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p>Under no circumstances is the full value of an environment variable sent, which is crucial for preserving user privacy and not potentially leaking sensitive data. The reason for spelling out the names of all the environment variables that are checked is so that if the set of variables that are checked changes in the future, it&#39;s possible to distinguish whether a variable was checked but unset from whether it was not checked at all.</p>
<h3 id=hyperloglog ><a href="#hyperloglog">HyperLogLog</a></h3>
<pre><code class="text hljs">Julia-HyperLogLog: 405,2</code></pre> The number of distinct values in a stream can be efficiently estimated using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog">HyperLogLog</a> estimator. Each client randomly chooses one of 1024 &quot;buckets&quot; which is the first value of this field and generates a random 64-bit unsigned integer and computes the number of trailing zeros of that value, which is the second value. In total, there are only 66,560 possible values for this header and since the second value is heavily skewed towards low values, there are many collisions. In short, this field cannot be used to track individual users. However, taken in aggregate, these random values can be used to roughly estimate the number of unique clients in a set of requests without needing unique client UUIDs. There are a number of drawbacks and limitations to this approach that make client UUIDs still beneficial for understanding Julia usage, but HyperLogLog parameters help understand some aspects of aggregate behavior even including users who opt out of sending client UUIDs.</p>
<h3 id=interactive ><a href="#interactive">Interactive</a></h3>
<pre><code class="text hljs">Julia-Interactive: true</code></pre> This is a boolean indicator of whether the client session is interactive—i.e. in the Julia REPL—or non-interactive, i.e. a script or other automated process. This serves two purposes: it further helps distinguish real users from CI systems &#40;the latter are never interactive&#41; and gives insight into how people use the package manager. The current assumption is that most people use Julia&#39;s package manager interactively, and thus the bulk of development effort has gone towards supporting and developing that use case. If we learn from this data that a larger than expected portion of people use the package manager in a non-interactive way, then we should devote more resources to supporting that use case.</p>
<h2 id=opting_out ><a href="#opting_out">Opting Out</a></h2>
<p>You can opt out of sending some or all of the above telemetry data to some or all package servers. This is done by editing <code>telemetry.toml</code> files saved in <code>~/.julia/servers/</code> on your local system. Telemetry file are used to store persistent data for each client, such as the client UUID, the secret salt string, and HyperLogLog values. For example, this would be typical content for a <code>~/.julia/servers/pkg.julialang.org/telemetry.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="toml hljs"><span class=hljs-attr >HyperLogLog</span> = [<span class=hljs-number >405</span>, <span class=hljs-number >2</span>]
<span class=hljs-attr >client_uuid</span> = <span class=hljs-string >&quot;afda810c-134c-4059-9594-3d1b0e9f0928&quot;</span>
<span class=hljs-attr >secret_salt</span> = <span class=hljs-string >&quot;0P7zbWDTAfsOmlh8j7Tq7yYNMiJ8ewIhzsj6&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>The directory the file appears in indicates that it&#39;s for the <code>pkg.julialang.org</code> package server. The entry for <code>HyperLogLog</code> and <code>client_uuid</code> give the plain values that are sent for those headers while the <code>secret_salt</code> field is not sent but is instead used when hashing the path of the active project to generate the <code>Julia-Project-Hash</code> header.</p>
<p>If you want to opt out of sending a client UUID and anything derived from it &#40;i.e. the project hash&#41;, you can edit this file and set <code>client_uuid &#61; false</code> to indicate that you are opting out. After changing that, <code>Pkg.telemetryinfo&#40;&#41;</code> prints this:</p>
<pre><code class="text hljs">Julia-Pkg-Protocol: 1.0
Julia-Version: 1.6.0-DEV.282
Julia-System: x86_64-apple-darwin14-libgfortran5
Julia-CI-Variables: APPVEYOR=n;CI=n;CIRCLECI=n;CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION=n;GITHUB_ACTIONS=n;GITLAB_CI=n;JULIA_CI=n;TF_BUILD=n;TRAVIS=n
Julia-HyperLogLog: 405,2
Julia-Interactive: true</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Julia-Client-UUID</code> and <code>Julia-Project-Hash</code> headers are omitted. If you want to only opt out of sending the project hash header, you can leave <code>client_uuid</code> as &#40;or delete it entirely and a new one will be generated&#41; and set <code>secret_salt &#61; falsse</code>, which results in this telemetry info:</p>
<pre><code class="text hljs">Julia-Pkg-Protocol: 1.0
Julia-Version: 1.6.0-DEV.282
Julia-System: x86_64-apple-darwin14-libgfortran5
Julia-Client-UUID: afda810c-134c-4059-9594-3d1b0e9f0928
Julia-CI-Variables: APPVEYOR=n;CI=n;CIRCLECI=n;CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION=n;GITHUB_ACTIONS=n;GITLAB_CI=n;JULIA_CI=n;TF_BUILD=n;TRAVIS=n
Julia-HyperLogLog: 405,2
Julia-Interactive: true</code></pre>
<p>If you want to opt out of sending telemetry header to a server altogether, you can put a <code>telemetry &#61; false</code> value anywhere in the server&#39;s telemetry file. In that case, only the <code>Julia-Pkg-Protocol</code> header will be sent, since it is necessary for correct interoperation between client and server.</p>
<p>Most users will only talk to the default package server, <code>pkg.julialang.org</code>, but some users may talk to multiple different package servers, which may be operated by other entities than the Julia project. The first time this happens, it will print a brief legal notice with a link to this page &#40;as it does the first time you connect to the default server&#41;. The telemetry file for each server will be saved in <code>~/.julia/servers/&#36;server/telemetry.toml</code> where <code>server</code> is the name of the server. If you create a <code>~/.julia/servers/telemetry.toml</code> file it will be used as a template for individual telemetry files. That means that if you want to default to opting out of generating and sending a client UUID to any new package server that you connect to, you can put <code>client_uuid &#61; false</code> in this file. Similarly, if you want to opt out of sending telemetry altogether when connecting to a new package server, you can put <code>telemetry &#61; false</code> in this file.</p>
<h2 id=data_analysis_amp_retention ><a href="#data_analysis_amp_retention">Data Analysis &amp; Retention</a></h2>
<p>Since the first version of Julia which connects to package servers by default is Julia 1.5, which has not yet been released, we have not yet begun analyzing the data sent by clients. Once we start to do this, details of this analysis will be provided here, including open source code which can be inspected and critiqued. The fully anonymous aggregate output of this analysis will be made publicly available and. We will also establish a data retention policy: all individual requested data collected will be kept for no more than a fixed period of time for analysis and then will be securely deleted.</div><br><br>
