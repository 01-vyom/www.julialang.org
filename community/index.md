# Mailing Lists

The [julia-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-users) mailing list is for discussion around the usage of julia. New users of julia can ask their questions here. As a courtesy to others, do check the archives and documentation to see if a particular question is already answered.

The [julia-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-dev) mailing list is for discussion related to the development of julia itself.

The [julia-stats](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-stats) mailing list is a special purpose mailing list for discussions related to statistical programming with julia. Topics of interest include DataFrame support, GLM modeling, and automatic generation of MCMC code for Bayesian models.

# GitHub

We use GitHub to track our source code and for tracking and discussing [issues](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues) and [commits](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/commits). There is also a list of [packages](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/packages/packagelist/) for Julia, many of which are also hosted on and developed using GitHub.

# IRC

Many Julia users and developers hang out in the [#julia IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=julia) on Freenode.
