# Mailing Lists

The [julia-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-users) mailing list is for discussion around the usage of julia. New users of julia can ask their questions here. As a courtesy to others, do check the archives and documentation to see if a particular question is already answered.

The [julia-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-dev) mailing list is for discussion related to the development of julia itself.

The [julia-stats](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-stats) mailing list is a special purpose mailing list for discussions related to statistical programming with julia. Topics of interest include DataFrame support, GLM modeling, and automatic generation of MCMC code for Bayesian models.

# GitHub

We use GitHub to track our source code and for tracking and discussing [issues](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues) and [commits](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/commits). There is also a list of [packages](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/packages/packagelist/) for Julia, many of which are also hosted on and developed using GitHub.

Various Julia projects are hosted under the following umbrella organizations on GitHub:

* [JuliaLang](https://github.com/JuliaLang) – the language
* [JuliaStats](https://github.com/JuliaStats) – statistics
* [JuliaOpt](https://github.com/JuliaOpt) – optimization
* [JuliaQuant](https://github.com/JuliaQuant) – finance
