# Tooling Projects â€“ Summer of Code

## VS Code extension

We are generally looking for folks that want to help with the [Julia VS Code extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/).
We have a long list of open issues, and some of them amount to significant projects.

**Required Skills**: TypeScript, julia, web development.

**Expected Results**: Depends on the specific projects we would agree on.

**Mentors**: [David Anthoff](https://github.com/davidanthoff)

## Package installation UI

The VSCode extension for Julia could provide a simple way to browse available packages and view what's installed on a users system. To start with, this project could simply provide a GUI that reads in package data from a `Project.toml`/`Manifest.toml` and show some UI elements to add/remove/manage those packages.

This could also be extended by having metadata about the package, such as a readme, github stars, activity and so on (somewhat similar to the VSCode-native extension explorer).

**Expected Results**: A UI in VSCode for package operations.

**Recommended Skills**: Familiarity with TypeScript and Julia development.

**Mentors**: [Sebastian Pfitzner](https://github.com/pfitzseb)

# Documentation tooling

## Documenter.jl

The Julia manual and the documentation for a large chunk of the ecosystem is generated using [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) -- essentially a static site generator that integrates with Julia and its docsystem. There are tons of opportunities for improvements for anyone interested in working on the interface of Julia, documentation and various front-end technologies (web, LaTeX).

* **ElasticSearch-based search backend for Documenter.** Loading the search page of Julia manual is slow because the index is huge and needs to be downloaded and constructed on the client side on every page load. Instead, we should look at hosting the search server-side. Goal is to continue the work done during a MLH fellowship for implementing an [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/)-based search backend.

* **Improve the generated PDF in the PDF/LaTeX backend.** The goals is to improve the look of the generated PDF and make sure backend works reliably (improved testing). See [#949](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/949), [#1342](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/1342) and [other related issues](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/labels/Format%3A%20LaTeX).

**Recommended skills:** Basic knowledge of web-development (JS, CSS, HTML) or LaTeX, depending on the project.

**Mentors:** [Morten Piibeleht](https://github.com/mortenpi)

## Docsystem API

Julia supports docstrings -- inline documentation which gets parsed together with the code and can be accessed dynamically in a Julia session (e.g. via the REPL `?>` help mode; implemented mostly in the [Docs module](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/tree/master/base/docs)).

Not all docstrings are created equal however. There are bugs in Julia's docsystem code, which means that some docstrings do not get stored or are stored with the wrong key (parametric methods). In addition, the API to fetch and work with docstrings programmatically is not documented, not considered public and could use some polishing.

@@tight-list
* Create a package which would provide a clean up the API for working with docstrings, and abstract away the implementation details (and potential differences between Julia versions) of the docsystem in Base.
* Fix as many docsystem-related bugs in the Julia core as possible [[further reading](http://mortenpi.eu/gsoc2019/latest/notes/docsystem-internals/#Docsystem-bugs-1), [#16730](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/16730), [#29437](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/29437), [JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl#558](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/558)]

**Recommended skills:** Basic familiarity with Julia is sufficient.

# Graphical user interfaces

## Interactive UI libraries and tooling

[WebIO.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/WebIO.jl) is an exciting new library that enables two-way interaction between julia and web technologies (html/css/js). We are looking for project proposals in, possibly a combination of the following areas:

@@tight-list
- Tools for building dashboards, and easily deploying them to the web, ala R's Shiny, and Plotly's dash
- Wrapping js libraries such as D3, interact.js, Plotly's dash?
- Reliability/Testing - (tools to) enable browser based automated tests for WebIO, InteractNext, and other projects built on WebIO

We're open to your project ideas. Join us on the [#gizmos slack channel](https://julialang.slack.com/messages/gizmos/) to discuss or ping `@shashi` or `@JobJob` in a [discourse post](https://discourse.julialang.org/).

**Required Skills**: Experience with JavaScript front-end development, some familiarity with Julia

**Mentors**: [Shashi Gowda](https://github.com/shashi), [Joel Mason](https://github.com/JobJob)

## GUI library integration

[QML.jl](https://github.com/barche/QML.jl) provides an interface to connect a [QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.10/qmlapplications.html) GUI to a Julia backend. Some ideas for improvement here are:

@@tight-list
* Use [Observables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Observables.jl) to provide a more "Julian" way to pass data between the GUI and Julia. Work on this has already started on the [observables branch](https://github.com/barche/QML.jl/tree/observables) in QML.jl. Discussion: https://github.com/barche/QML.jl/issues/43
* Support [DataFrames.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl) directly for creating an editable TableView. Inspiration: https://discourse.julialang.org/t/visual-workflow-tool-for-julia-lets-build-one/9384/4
* Make one [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) GUI to rule them all. Inspiration: https://discourse.julialang.org/t/best-plot-package/7458 and https://discourse.julialang.org/t/where-is-actual-development-in-plotting/6224
* Build QmlReactive (but using Observables maybe). Inspiration: https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/GtkReactive.jl

**Required Skills**: Some familiarity with Julia, prior QML experience would also help.

**Mentors**: [Bart Janssens](https://github.com/barche), [Shashi Gowda](https://github.com/shashi) for the Observables part
