# Graphical user interfaces

## GUI library integration

[QML.jl](https://github.com/barche/QML.jl) provides an interface to connect a [QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.10/qmlapplications.html) GUI to a Julia backend. Some ideas for improvement here are:

@@tight-list
* Use [Observables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Observables.jl) to provide a more "Julian" way to pass data between the GUI and Julia. Work on this has already started on the [observables branch](https://github.com/barche/QML.jl/tree/observables) in QML.jl. Discussion: https://github.com/barche/QML.jl/issues/43
* Support [DataFrames.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl) directly for creating an editable TableView. Inspiration: https://discourse.julialang.org/t/visual-workflow-tool-for-julia-lets-build-one/9384/4
* Make one [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) GUI to rule them all. Inspiration: https://discourse.julialang.org/t/best-plot-package/7458 and https://discourse.julialang.org/t/where-is-actual-development-in-plotting/6224
* Build QmlReactive (but using Observables maybe). Inspiration: https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/GtkReactive.jl

**Required Skills**: Some familiarity with Julia, prior QML experience would also help.

**Mentors**: [Bart Janssens](https://github.com/barche), [Shashi Gowda](https://github.com/shashi) for the Observables part
