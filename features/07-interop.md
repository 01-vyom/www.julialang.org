## Julia can talk to your favorite language!

C FFI is built into the language. Zero overhead.

Python can be called using the [PyCall](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) package. Zero overhead. Julia arrays can be treated as numpy arrays without copying.

R can be called using the [RCall](https://github.com/JuliaStats/RCall.jl) package.

Java can be called with [JavaCall](https://github.com/aviks/JavaCall.jl).

There is also support for calling [MATLAB](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/MATLAB.jl) and [Mathematica](https://github.com/MikeInnes/Mathematica.jl)
