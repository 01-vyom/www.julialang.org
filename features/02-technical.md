## Julia is geared towards technical computing

Julia targets the technical computing niche. It was born out of [frustration with existing technical computing environments](http://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia), and it is carefully designed to be convenient, expressive and comfortable for numerical work.

Convenient array indexing syntax

Concise notation for linear algebra

Powerful built-in functions for numerical computing

It has a package ecosystem created by peers in technical computing. The packages span fields such as statistical biology, image processing, economics, finance, mechanical engineering and a lot more.
