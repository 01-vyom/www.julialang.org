# Application Guidelines

Proposals are free form â€“ you can write about your project however you want, but make sure it's clear what it's about, why you're the best person to do it, and how we can contact you.

Things you might include:

* A timeline with periodic milestones
* Record of contributions to Julia / other open-source projects
* Qualifications / experience
* Your reasons for working on Julia

We're also happy to receive multiple applications from students, but remember that quality is more important than quantity.
