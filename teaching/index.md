title:  Using Julia in the classroom
---

Julia is ready for the classroom. We encourage instructors to particpate
on the [mailing lists](http://julialang.org/community/) for questions
regarding the readiness of Julia or specific packages.

For a quick introduction to Julia, see these [introductory slides](https://github.com/ViralBShah/julia-presentations/raw/master/Fifth-Elephant-2013/Fifth-Elephant-2013.pdf).

Steve Johnson maintains an excellent resource for using [Julia in the
classroom at MIT](https://github.com/stevengj/julia-mit/).

# Installing Julia

The Julia and [IPython](http://ipython.org) teams have collaborated to
develop [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl), which
provides a powerful graphical notebook interface to Julia.

[Julia binaries](http://julialang.org/downloads/) are available for
Mac and Windows. It is also easy to [build from
source](http://github.com/juliaLang/julia/) on Linux, Mac, and
Windows.

# Julia packages

The Julia community has put together a number of
[packages](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/packages/packagelist/)
spanning multiple disciplines.

# The Julia manual

The [Julia manual](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/) contains a
complete introduction to the Julia language. It is available in
[Chinese](http://julia-zh-cn.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), while
[Spanish](http://julia-es-la.readthedocs.org/) and
[Portuguese](http://julia-pt-br.readthedocs.org/) translations are in
the works.

# Videos

We recorded a number of
[videos](http://julialang.org/blog/2013/03/julia-tutorial-MIT/) as
part of the Julia tutorial at MIT in January 2013. These videos are
published in the [Julia channel on
Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/JuliaLanguage). [Slides](http://beowulf.csail.mit.edu/18.337/index.html)
and other material from the tutorial are available on GitHub.
