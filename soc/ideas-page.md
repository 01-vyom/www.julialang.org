# GSoC Project Ideas Page

Thanks for your interest in Summer of Code! This page outlines some ideas for student projects. Most project ideas come with a suggested set of skills and experience which will be helpful, but they aren't hard requirements and there's scope for learning and exploring before, during, and after the official Summer of Code period. Please contact us at juliasoc@googlegroups.com with your questions.

We encourage you to send us a proposal through the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com); you're welcome to flesh out one of these projects with your own ideas, or to come up with something completely different. We also have some [application guidelines](/soc/guidelines) for more suggestions on writing a proposal.

You can [**edit this page**](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julialang.github.com/edit/master/soc/ideas-page.md) through GitHub if you want to add ideas of your own. For previous Summer of Code projects, see the [Archive page](/soc/archive.html).

## Moving Forward

Once you have an idea or area of interest, the best way to move forward is to get involved in relevant areas of the Julia ecosystem – look out for packages or organisations which are working on similar things, and see what features and issues they have. It's great to start by solving some small issues, and making real patches will show us your coding skills, your ability to learn, and your commitment.

If there's no directly relevant package, you could also start your own to begin prototyping your idea. It's not an absolute requirement, but a few lines of real code will really bolster an application.

Talking to others in the community is also a good way to get introduced to potential mentors. If you've spoken to someone who has agreed to mentor, let us know, but it's not a requirement for the application.
