# {{ page.title }}

{% include toc.html %}

[JuliaImages](https://github.com/JuliaImages) has recently undergone a significant revamp, with many improvements in the core infrastructure, project organization, and documentation. For the future, a major push is on expanding the functionality. Please see the [documentation](http://juliaimages.github.io/latest/) for information about the current state; perhaps the [feature comparison matrix](http://juliaimages.github.io/latest/api_comparison.html) may be particularly useful for generating further ideas about possible ways to contribute.

## Interactivity and visualization tools

Image processing often involves tight interaction between algorithms and visualization. While there are a number of older tools available, leveraging GLVisualize seems to hold the greatest promise. This project might implement a number of interactive tools for region-of-interest selection, annotation, measurement, and modification.  Software suites like OpenCV, ImageJ/Fiji, scikit-image, and Matlab might serve as inspiration.

**Recommended skills:** Previous experience developing GUIs.

**Expected Results:** Building blocks for developing custom GUIs for interactive image processing and analysis.  Possible creation of an interactive "shell application" similar to ImageJ.

**Mentors:** [Simon Danisch](https://github.com/SimonDanisch), [Tim Holy](https://github.com/timholy/), and [Ron Rock](https://github.com/rsrock).

## Integration of OpenCV and JuliaImages

OpenCV is one of the pre-eminent image-processing frameworks, and there is an existing [OpenCV wrapper](https://github.com/maxruby/OpenCV.jl). This project would update it for more recent versions of Julia and JuliaImages, convert it into a module, improve interoperability with pure-Julia image processing, and make further refinements to code and documentation. In areas of overlap between pure-Julia and OpenCV functionality, one would also implement a set of benchmarks for performance comparisons.

**Recommended skills:** Previous experience using OpenCV in C++ or one of the bindings for other languages.

**Expected Results:** A rejuvinated OpenCV package that integrates more effectively into the ecosystem of JuliaImages.

**Mentors:** [Maximiliano Suster](https://github.com/maxruby) and [Tim Holy](https://github.com/timholy/).

## Contributions to a Stereo Matching Package

When two images are taken of a scene with a calibrated stereo rig it is possible to construct a three-dimensional model of the scene provided that one can determine the coordinates of corresponding points in the two images. The task of determining the coordinates of corresponding points is frequenly called *stereo matching* or *disparity estimation*. Numerous algorithms for this task have been proposed over the years and new ones continue to be developed. 

This project will implement several stereo matching algorithms. Emphasis will be placed on *efficient* implementations which leverage all of Julia's features for writing fast code. 

Example algorithms: 
  1. Bleyer, Michael, Christoph Rhemann, and Carsten Rother. "PatchMatch Stereo-Stereo Matching with Slanted Support Windows." Bmvc. Vol. 11. 2011.
  2. Hirschmuller, Heiko. "Accurate and efficient stereo processing by semi-global matching and mutual information." Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2005. CVPR 2005. IEEE Computer Society Conference on. Vol. 2. IEEE, 2005.
  3. Gehrig, Stefan K., and Clemens Rabe. "Real-time semi-global matching on the CPU." Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on. IEEE, 2010.

**Recommended skills:** Familiarity with typical Julia performance traps and ability to benchmark code. Ideally you will have some awareness of which operations allocate memory, what a "view" of a matrix is, and what it means to write "type-stable" code. 

**Expected Results:** Fast implementations of both classic and more recent stereo matching algorithms.
