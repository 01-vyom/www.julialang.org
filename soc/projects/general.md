## Expanding and improving LearnBase/JuliaML

[LearnBase](https://github.com/Evizero/LearnBase.jl) is an attempt to create common abstractions and tools for machine learning frameworks. Common functionality like data loading, loss functions or training processes can be defined generically, and then easily combined with a specific approach (e.g. an SVM).

Possible projects are:
  * Contributing to the generic functionality in JuliaML (e.g. creating or improving a package for loading data sets, or implementing training process, etc)
  * Pure-Julia implementations of specific model types (e.g. decision trees or SVMs) which integrate with the JuliaML ecosystem.

**Required Skills**: Knowledge of the machine learning technique(s) to be implemented.

**Recommended Skills**: General knowledge of the JuliaML project and aims, or wide knowledge of machine learning as a field, is a plus.

**Mentors**: [Christof Stocker](https://github.com/Evizero), [Tom Breloff](https://github.com/tbreloff), [JuliaML Members](https://github.com/orgs/JuliaML/people)

## Standardized dataset packaging

Scientific and technical computing often makes use of publicly available datasets. Often, there's a lot of overhead to finding these data sets and coercing them into a usable format. Packages like [RDatasets.jl](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/RDatasets.jl/) and [MNIST.jl](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/MNIST.jl) attempt to make this easier by downloading data automatically and providing it as a Julia data structure.

This project involves building a "[BinDeps.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/BinDeps.jl) for data" which would make the creation of data-providing packages easier. The package would make it easy to download / unzip large files and check their integrity them in a cross-platform way. Facilities for downloading specific datasets can then be built on top of this.

**Expected Results**: A BinDeps-like package for downloading and managing data, as well as examples of this package used with specific data sets.

**Recommended Skills**: Only standard programming skills are needed for this project. Familiarity with Julia is a plus.

## Enhanced clipboard

Julia's functions for getting and setting the clipboard are currently limited to text; it would be useful to extend them to allow the transfer of other data (for example, spreadsheet data or images).

**Expected Results**: Extensible `clipboard()` and `clipboard(x)` functions to get and set the richest possible representation of the system clipboard data, as well as methods for specific types.

**Recommended skills**: Interfacing with C from Julia, clipboard APIs for different platforms. Familiarity with FileIO.jl.

## Calling Julia from Python

Julia could be a great replacement for C in Python projects, where it can be used to speed up bottlenecks without sacrificing ease of use. However, while the basic functionality for communicating with Julia exists in [PyCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) and [pyjulia](https://github.com/jakebolewski/pyjulia), it needs to be separated out and mantained as a real Python package.

**Expected Results**: An easy-to-use Python package which allows Julia functions to be imported and called, with transparent conversion of data.

**Recommended skills**: Familiarity with both Python and Julia, especially C interop.

## Middlewares for common web application chores in Mux.jl

Implementation of mid-level features - specifically routing, load-balancing, cookie/session handling, and authentication - in [Mux.jl](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/Mux.jl).  The implementation should be extensible enough to allow easy interfacing with different kinds of caching, databases or authentication backends. (See [Clojure/Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki/Why-Use-Ring%3F) for inspiration).

**Expected Results**: Improvements to the Mux.jl package.

**Required Skills**: Experience with web development.

**Recommended Skills**: Knowledge of various web frameworks, especially the design decisions and tradeoffs behind them.
