## Expanding and improving LearnBase/JuliaML

[LearnBase](https://github.com/Evizero/LearnBase.jl) is an attempt to create a complete well-abstracted set of primitives and tools for machine learning frameworks.  The goal is to find the overlap between research perspectives and create smart abstractions for common components such as loss functions, transformations, activation functions, etc.  These abstractions can be the building blocks for more flexible learning frameworks, incorporating models (SVM, regression, decision trees, neural networks, etc) into a unified framework more powerful than alternatives (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc).

A student could contribute to the core abstractions, or to dependent learning frameworks, depending on their knowledge and interests.  It is expected that the student has prior knowledge of machine learning techniques which they would like to work with.  In order to meaningfully contribute to the core abstractions, a broad knowledgebase would be expected.  Specific experience with random forests or deep/recurrent neural networks would be a plus.
