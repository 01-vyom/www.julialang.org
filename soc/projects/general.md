## Calling Julia from Python

Julia could be a great replacement for C in Python projects, where it can be used to speed up bottlenecks without sacrificing ease of use. However, while the basic functionality for communicating with Julia exists in [PyCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) and [pyjulia](https://github.com/jakebolewski/pyjulia), it needs to be separated out and maintained as a real Python package.

**Expected Results**: An easy-to-use Python package which allows Julia functions to be imported and called, with transparent conversion of data.

**Recommended skills**: Familiarity with both Python and Julia, especially C interop.

**Mentors**: [Steven Johnson](https://github.com/stevengj)

## Calling Julia shared libraries from Python

Similar to the above, but involving [PackageCompiler](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl) to remove JIT overhead.
The successful candidate will start off from the [prototype](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl/pull/26)
and will make sure that linking a shared Julia library to Python works on all platforms.
If there is still time after this, the project can be extended to make the interaction
between Python and Julia work smoothly.
We will need to make sure that all functions can be called with rich
python datatypes, and that conversions to common Julia datatypes happens automatically.
If the conversion can't happen automatically, we need to make sure that there are easy ways
to convert a Python object to the correct Julia object.

**Recommended skills**: This project will require strong knowledge about compiling and linking binaries.
**Expected Results**: An easy way to call into static julia libraries without JIT overhead and with automatic type conversions.

## Middlewares for common web application chores in Mux.jl

Implementation of mid-level features - specifically routing, load-balancing, cookie/session handling, and authentication - in [Mux.jl](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/Mux.jl).  The implementation should be extensible enough to allow easy interfacing with different kinds of caching, databases or authentication backends. (See [Clojure/Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki/Why-Use-Ring%3F) for inspiration).

**Expected Results**: Improvements to the Mux.jl package.

**Required Skills**: Experience with web development.

**Recommended Skills**: Knowledge of various web frameworks, especially the design decisions and tradeoffs behind them.

## Minecraft Examples for Julia on the Raspberry Pi

Minecraft is, by some measures, the most popular video game ever. On the Raspberry Pi, the Minecraft
world can be programatically controlled. This provides an incredible platform to teach children to code --
an unique combination of the physical and the virtual.

This project will aim to create content in the form of example programs that showcase using Julia on the Pi
to control Minecraft. Some inspiration might be derived from a [similar book in R](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/miner_book).
This code will use the [PiCraft.jl](https://github.com/JuliaBerry/PiCraft.jl) Julia package which provides the infrastructure to
connect to Minecraft on the Pi.

**Expected Results**: A set of example programs with documentation

**Recommended skills**: Basic Julia programming skills, some familiarity with R *or* Python. Access to a Rasberry Pi will be helpful.

**Mentors**: [Avik Sengupta](https://github.com/aviks/)

## Liquid Templating Library

[Liquid](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/) is a popular templating library, used primarily from Ruby. A pure Julia implementation
of Liquid would be useful for web application authors in Julia.

**Expected Results**: A pure Julia package that can compile a liquid template to Julia code.

**Recommended skills**: Basic Julia programming skills. Familiarity with parsing techniques.  

**Mentors**: [Avik Sengupta](https://github.com/aviks/)

## Enhanced clipboard

Julia's functions for getting and setting the clipboard are currently limited to text; it would be useful to extend them to allow the transfer of other data (for example, spreadsheet data or images).

**Expected Results**: Extensible `clipboard()` and `clipboard(x)` functions to get and set the richest possible representation of the system clipboard data, as well as methods for specific types.

**Recommended skills**: Interfacing with C from Julia, clipboard APIs for different platforms. Familiarity with FileIO.jl.

## QML.jl Improvements

The [QML.jl](https://github.com/barche/QML.jl) package provides Julia bindings for [Qt QML](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-index.html) on Windows, OS X and Linux. In the current state, basic functionality is available, but there is room for improvement regarding integration with [GLVisualize](https://github.com/JuliaGL/GLVisualize.jl) and plotting packages such as [GR](https://github.com/jheinen/GR.jl) (see also [issue 23](https://github.com/barche/QML.jl/issues/23)) or [Plots](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl). Another area of work is supporting more elaborate data models.

**Expected Results**: Improvements to the QML.jl package along one of these lines.

**Recommended Skills**: Familiarity with both Julia and the QT framework.

**Mentors**: [Bart Janssens](https://github.com/barche)

## Data Structure Algorithm Improvements

While many common data structures are encouraged to be implemented in packages, to encourage more experimentation, some are so basic they need to be in Base. There are a number of projects that could be done to improve the quality, performance, or usability of these builtin structures. Some ideas include:

- Changing Base.Dict to an ordered dict representation (http://juliacollections.github.io/DataStructures.jl/latest/ordered_containers.html, https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/10116)
- Experiment with using alternative Dict hash structures (such as Robin Hood Hashing, used by [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html))
- Implementation and tests for assorted asynchronous, threaded storage primitives and data channels

**Recommended Skills**: Ability to write type-stable Julia code. Ability to find performance issues. Knowledge about data structures and related algorithms.
