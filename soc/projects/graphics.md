## QML.jl Improvements

The [QML.jl](https://github.com/barche/QML.jl) package provides Julia bindings for [Qt QML](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-index.html) on Windows, OS X and Linux. In the current state, basic functionality is available, but there is room for improvement regarding integration with [GLVisualize](https://github.com/JuliaGL/GLVisualize.jl) and plotting packages such as [GR](https://github.com/jheinen/GR.jl) (see also [issue 23](https://github.com/barche/QML.jl/issues/23)) or [Plots](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl). Another area of work is supporting more elaborate data models.

## Improvements to the Plots.jl ecosystem

[Plots.jl](https://github.com/tbreloff/Plots.jl) has become the preferred graphical interface for many users.  It has the potential to become the standard Julia interface for data visualization, and there are many potential ways that a student could contribute:

- Expanding backend support.  Integration with real-time visualization platforms ([GLVisualize.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGL/GLVisualize.jl)).  Easy latex plotting for scientific research publications ([PGFPlots.jl](https://github.com/sisl/PGFPlots.jl)).
- Adding recipes for statistics, machine learning (see [MLPlots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaML/MLPlots.jl)), or any other fields which you have an interest.
- Documentation and/or tutorials.
- Better integration with Graphs, DataStreams, etc.
- Improved support for the Grammar of Graphics API in Plots.jl via [GGPlots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/GGPlots.jl).
