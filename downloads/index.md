# Download

Download location: [http://code.google.com/p/julialang/downloads/list](http://code.google.com/p/julialang/downloads/list).

If the provided download files do not work for you, please [file an issue](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues). You may also consider [building from source](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).

# Instructions for Windows users

Currently, Julia is available only for 32-bit Windows.

1. Download the Windows zip file (Make sure you get the version with Git included).
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Double-click julia.bat in the unzipped folder to start julia.

# Instructions for OS X users

On Mac, a Julia-version.dmg file is provided, which contains Julia.app. Installation is the same as any other Mac software. You need OS X Lion (10.7) or later to use the precompiled binaries. Julia works with OS X Snow Leopard (10.6), but needs to be built from source.

# Instructions for Linux users

Instructions will be added here as more linux distributions start including julia. If your Linux distribution is not listed here, you should still be able to run julia by building from source.

1. [Ubuntu 13.04](http://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/julia): apt-get install julia
