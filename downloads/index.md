Download the relevant julia distribution for your Operating system from [http://code.google.com/p/julialang/downloads/list](http://code.google.com/p/julialang/downloads/list). If this does not work for you, please [file an issue](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues). You may also want to try [building from source](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).
