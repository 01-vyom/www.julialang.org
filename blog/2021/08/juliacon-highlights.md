## JuMP-Dev 2021

We were excited to have the JuMP-dev conference co-located within JuliaCon for the first time this year. It was an awesome oppurtunity to get the users and developers from the JuMP-dev community engaged with the greator Julia community. You can check out the JuMP videos from conference in [this JuMP dedicated playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6Rf8_oh9oR2bNeBO-Rw8pzc).

## Code, Docs and Tests: What’s In the General Registry?

Mosè Giordano and Eric P. Hanson presented [Code, Docs and Tests: What’s In the General Registry?](https://live.juliacon.org/talk/HVSAW9)  

The General registry is the collection of open source packages that makes up the Julia package ecosystem. The Julia General registry has **11.8 million lines of code** (including docs and tests). More than 96% of packages have an Open Source Initiative approved license, 88% have at least 20 lines of readme or docs, 96% have run tests, 95% have setup for continuous integration, 58% of packages have at least 2 contributors, 93% have at least 10 commits, 48% of contributors have contributed to two or more packages and 60% of contributors have made at least 5 commits. There are 4,931 Julia contributors who have contributed to packages in the General registry.

## State of Julia

Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Keno Fischer and Viral Shah presented the [State of Julia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFVwabDh6Q&list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q343_8sSq4f306VGLW4TLK&index=222), including recent and future improvements.

These include speed increases for CSV.jl and DataFrames.jl, packages reaching 1.0, threading roadmap, faster method insertion, small type info improvements, inference improvements, subtyping and intersection fixes and speedups, CI stability, latency, system images, array optimizations, GC performance, compiler extensibility, new compiler directions, AbstractInterpreter, OpaqueClosure, compiler plugins, Automatic Differentiation, BLAS, sparse matrices and linear algebra.

## Julia User & Developer Survey

The third annual [Julia User & Developer Survey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XSk5zybfic) was presented. 2,660 Julia users and developers from 104 countries participated, and explained how much and why they love Julia and the Julia community, as well as their biggest pain points and areas for improvement.

## Beyond JuliaCon 2021

As you might be able to tell, this years conference was another massive leap for the Julia community. The work required to put on a conference of this size cannot be understated. If you would be interested in helping with future iterations of JuliaCon, we would love to hear from you! Please see this [Volunteer form](https://forms.gle/2KnYko7HnGKLvHJB7) and do reachout if you want to help. 

We also still have a [general JuliaCon 2021 feedback form](https://forms.gle/7w9q1MBow5u9kUGY7) live. Please feel free to send over any feedback on the conference as we are always interested in improving the experience.

Again, huge thank you to the conference speakers, attendees, and volunteers for making this year such a huge success! We look forward to seeing you all again soon.
