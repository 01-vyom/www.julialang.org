This year’s [JuliaCon](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q343_8sSq4f306VGLW4TLK) was the biggest and best ever, with [more than 300 presentations available for free on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q343_8sSq4f306VGLW4TLK), more than 20 thousand registrations and more than 43 thousand unique YouTube viewers during the conference.  

We extend a heartfelt congratulations and thank you to the JuliaCon committee and all of the organizers, presenters and participants.  

There were more than 300 presentations this year and nearly all of them are already available for free on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q343_8sSq4f306VGLW4TLK).  

**Julia Community Prize Winners**  

Congratulations to the winners of the [Julia Community Prize](https://juliacon.org/2021/prize/). [The presentation is available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIFJT6Zt_yk&list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q343_8sSq4f306VGLW4TLK&index=227). The winners are:  

*   **Bogumił Kamiński & Milan Bouchet-Valat** for their custodianship of DataFrames.jl and the data ecosystem
*   **Fons van der Plas** for his work on Pluto.jl
*   **Dilum Aluthge** for his contributions to our community infrastructure and community building

**Keynote Speeches**  

This year’s keynote speeches were stellar, and among the most viewed presentations of the conference.  

*   **Jan Vitek**, Professor of Computer Science at Northeastern University presented [Julia: Great Language, or The Greatest Language?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT4AP7CUMAw)
*   **Xiaoye (Sherry) Li**, Senior Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory presented [Interplay of Linear Algebra, Machine Learning and HPC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUyddZQaeyg)
*   **Soumith Chintala**, Distinguished Engineer at Facebook AI Research presented [PyTorch and My Journey in Open Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6jk_OdH-w) 

**Code, Docs and Tests: What’s In the General Registry?**  

Mosè Giordano and Eric P. Hanson presented [Code, Docs and Tests: What’s In the General Registry?](https://live.juliacon.org/talk/HVSAW9)  

The General registry is the collection of open source packages that makes up the Julia package ecosystem. The Julia General registry has **11.8 million lines of code** (including docs and tests). More than 96% of packages have an Open Source Initiative approved license, 88% have at least 20 lines of readme or docs, 96% have run tests, 95% have setup for continuous integration, 58% of packages have at least 2 contributors, 93% have at least 10 commits, 48% of contributors have contributed to two or more packages and 60% of contributors have made at least 5 commits. There are 4,931 Julia contributors who have contributed to packages in the General registry.  

**State of Julia**  

Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Keno Fischer and Viral Shah presented the [State of Julia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFVwabDh6Q&list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q343_8sSq4f306VGLW4TLK&index=222), including recent and future improvements.  

DevClass published a summary of the presentation titled [State of Julia: The Future Looks Modular, Generic, and Fast](https://devclass.com/2021/08/05/state-of-julia-language-2021/) which explains many of the highlights.  

These include speed increases for CSV.jl and DataFrames.jl, packages reaching 1.0, threading roadmap, faster method insertion, small type info improvements, inference improvements, subtyping and intersection fixes and speedups, CI stability, latency, system images, array optimizations, GC performance, compiler extensibility, new compiler directions, AbstractInterpreter, OpaqueClosure, compiler plugins, AD, BLAS, sparse matrices and linear algebra.  

**Julia User & Developer Survey**  

The third annual [Julia User & Developer Survey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XSk5zybfic) was presented. 2,660 Julia users and developers from 104 countries participated, and explained how much and why they love Julia and the Julia community, as well as their biggest pain points and areas for improvement.
